# Assignment1 - Practice Designing Models (Template)

> * Participant name: Markus Loennig
> * Project Title: Motion Activated, Solar powered Technical solution for Electrically Redundant (MASTER) City Lighting
## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

This proposed solution will regard 3 aspects in a Smart City. Clean electicity generation and storage (solar powered), clean and free personal mobility (E-Bikes) and improved, power saving street lighting (motion sensors). 
1. Electricity will be generated by solar panels and stored by the bike stands and the repective E-Bikes. They will be the power-source for the city street lighting during the night/dark. The stored electricity in the bikestands and the E-Bikes can also be used to locally buffer power shortages/outages in case of emergencies (Hurricane) in the respective vicinity.
2. The E-bikes will be available especially in the vicinity of business centers, knots of public transportation and centralized parking facilities to be used to go to work (without congesting the city centers) in the morning and go back to the respective transportation means in the evening/after work. They are free to use for a certain period of time (e.g. 60 min), in which they have to be put into a bikestand (loading station) again. Another E-Bike can be used immediatly. Longer usage of the same bike will result in (small-moderate) costs.
3. During dark hours, the E-Bike usage will be significantly less so the stored power will be available to power the city lighting. The lighting is motion sensitive and equipped with certain logic to only lighten streets where it is necessary due to pedestrian or car traffic. Other sensors and systems (e.g. automatic 911 in case of accident/violence..) can be integrated into the lighting system, but this is not the topic for this aspects solution.

Historical context: quite a few major cities in Europe offer such a Bike rental system (free for some period of time), some even with E-Bikes, but none use the E-Bikes as "electrical infrastructure" or to power other systems. Japan is researching the possibility to use E-Cars (especially the ones generating power like the "Prius") to integrate them into the electrical distribution system in case of emergency (earthquake) to buffer local shortages. 
The proposed "MASTER City Lighting" solution adapted this idea on a smaller scale.


## Requirements (Experimental Design)

(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)

## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )

* [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) - provides the high level overview of components
* [**Class Diagram**](model/class_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Behavior Diagram**](model/behavior_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Agent / User case** (if appropriate)](model/agent_usecase_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: for part 3 add two to three sentences here and link the [**(your own name)**](model/README.md) file in the analysis folder - which describe how you would simulate this - type of simulation, rough details -inputs, outputs - how it will help you analyze your experimental hypothesis, or nullify your null hypothesis.)
