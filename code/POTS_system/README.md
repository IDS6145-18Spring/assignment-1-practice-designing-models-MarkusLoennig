## **P**ortable **O**rganic **T**rouble-free **S**elf-watering System (**POTS**) Model

The POTS system should be (in a hierarchical sense) on top, but due to space reasons, I put it in the middle. 

Logically it is still on top, since the other 4 classes inherit attributes from "the parent" (see object diagram above)
