## Smart City (My Problem) Model - Object Diagram

This high level, object diagram illustrates which systems are involved in the intended solution and how the involved systems are linked to each other. The heart of the system is the Bikestand, which is charged by the Solar Panel.
The Bikestand charges the E-Bikes, which are additional power sources when they are not used. 
The Bikestand and E_bikes store the generated and unused power for later to power a highly efficient street lighting system. The system is intended to be self sufficient, with no necessary power consumption from outside the system. 

This safes significant ressources over time, contributes to the relieve of traffic burden of a modern city, creates value in the touristic area and and contribute to precautionary meassures for disaster relief/power outages.
